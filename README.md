# BwInf-40-erste-Runde
My solutions to the tasks of the 40th Federal Computer Science Competition of the first round.

I solved the tasks to further my programming skills and problem solving skills and did not participated in this year's Federal Computer Science competition. Through Federal Computer Science Competitions from the previous years, I was able to gain a lot of experience and really enjoyed working on it.
